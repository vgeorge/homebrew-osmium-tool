# `osmium-tool` brew tap (Versioned)

This is a custom brew tap for installing specific versions of `osmium-tool`.

Available formulae are:

- osmium-tool-version@1.5

## How do I install these formulae?

If `osmium-tool` from homebrew-core is installed, remove it to avoid conflicts:

`brew remove osmium-tool`

`brew install vgeorge/osmium-tool/<formula>`

Or `brew tap vgeorge/osmium-tool` and then `brew install <formula>`.
